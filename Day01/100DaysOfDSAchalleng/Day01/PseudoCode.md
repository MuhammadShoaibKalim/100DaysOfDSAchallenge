# Pseudocode vs. Algorithm vs. Flowchart

Welcome to the Pseudocode vs. Algorithm vs. Flowchart repository! This repository provides an overview of pseudocode, algorithms, and flowcharts, highlighting their differences and usage in problem-solving and algorithm design.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an intermediate step between an algorithm and its implementation in a programming language. It is a step-by-step description of an algorithm in plain English text, intended for human understanding rather than machine reading.

### Need for Pseudocode

Pseudocode is crucial for designing algorithms as it aids in planning the solution to a problem and helps readers understand the approach. It serves as an intermediary between the algorithm and the program, facilitating the transition from concept to code.

### How to Write Pseudocode

Before writing pseudocode, consider the following points:

- Organize the sequence of tasks according to the problem.
- Establish the main goal or aim of the algorithm.
- Use standard programming structures such as if-else, for, while, etc.
- Indent statements for better readability.
- Follow appropriate naming conventions.
- Represent reserved commands or keywords in capital letters.
- Ensure completeness, finiteness, and clarity.
- Use simple and easy-to-understand language, minimizing technical terms.

## Algorithm

An algorithm provides a step-by-step solution to a problem in a well-defined, step-based form. It uses simple English words to describe the solution process.

## Difference between Pseudocode and Algorithm

- An algorithm is a solution to a problem presented in a step-based form, while pseudocode is a textual representation of an algorithm.
- Pseudocode uses code-like structures in plain English text, while algorithms only use simple English words.
- There are certain rules for writing pseudocode, whereas there are no strict rules for writing algorithms.
- Algorithms can be considered as pseudocode, but pseudocode cannot be considered as an algorithm.

## Flowchart

A flowchart is a pictorial representation of the flow of an algorithm, depicting the sequence of steps and decision-making processes.

### Difference between Flowchart and Pseudocode

- Flowcharts use standard symbols for input, output, decisions, start, and stop statements, while pseudocode uses reserved keywords like if-else, for, while, etc.
- Flowcharts are graphical representations, while pseudocode is textual.
- Flowcharts are suitable for documentation purposes, whereas pseudocode is better for understanding the logic of an algorithm.
